# JavaScript Bug: TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'length')

This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript error: `TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'length')`. The bug occurs when attempting to access the `length` property of a variable that is null or undefined.

## Bug Description

The provided `bug.js` file contains a function that is vulnerable to this error. The function checks if the input `x` is null and handles it correctly, but it fails to correctly check if the input is a valid object with a length property before accessing that property.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version.  It adds a check to ensure that the input `x` is not only not null but also an object and has a length property before accessing it.   This check prevents the error by handling cases where the input may not be an object or does not have the length property.
